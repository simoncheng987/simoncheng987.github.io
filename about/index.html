<p><strong>ELEC3506 Data Communications and the Internet</strong></p>
<p>Credit points: 6 Session: Semester 2 Classes: Refer to the unit of study outline <a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/units">https://www.sydney.edu.au/units</a> Assessment: Refer to the assessment table in the unit outline. Mode of delivery: Normal (lecture/lab/tutorial) day
Students undertaking this unit should be familiar with fundamental digital technologies and representations such as bit complement and internal word representation. Students should also have a basic understanding of the physical properties of communication channels, techniques and limitations. Furthermore, students should be able to apply fundamental mathematical skills.
The unit will cover the following specific material: Communication reference models (TCP/IP and OSI). Circuit switched and packet switched communication. Network node functions and building blocks. LAN, MAN, WAN, WLAN technologies. Protocols fundamental mechanisms. The TCP/IP core protocols (IP, ICMP, DHCP, ARP, TCP, UDP etc. ). Applications and protocols (ftP, Telnet, SMTP, HTTP etc. ), Network Management and Security.</p>
<p><strong>COMP3419 Graphics and Multimedia</strong>
Credit points: 6 Session: Semester 2 Classes: Refer to the unit of study outline <a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/units">https://www.sydney.edu.au/units</a> Prerequisites: COMP2123 OR COMP2823 OR INFO1105 OR INFO1905 Assumed knowledge: Programming skills Assessment: Refer to the assessment table in the unit outline. Mode of delivery: Normal (lecture/lab/tutorial) day
This unit provides a broad introduction to the field of graphics and multimedia computing to meet the diverse requirements of application areas such as entertainment, industrial design, virtual reality, intelligent media management, social media and remote sensing. It covers both the underpinning theories and the practices of computing and manipulating digital media including graphics / image, audio, animation, and video. Emphasis is placed on principles and cutting-edge techniques for multimedia data processing, content analysis, media retouching, media coding and compression.</p>
<p><strong>ELEC5620 Model Based Software Engineering</strong>
Credit points: 6 Session: Semester 2 Classes: Refer to the unit of study outline <a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/units">https://www.sydney.edu.au/units</a> Assumed knowledge: A programming language, basic maths. Assessment: Refer to the assessment table in the unit outline. Mode of delivery: Normal (lecture/lab/tutorial) day
Model-Based Software Engineering focuses on modern software engineering methods, technologies, and processes used in professional development projects. It covers both the pragmatic engineering elements and the underlying theory of the model-based approach to the analysis, design, implementation, and maintenance of complex software-intensive systems.</p>
<p>Students will participate in a group project, which will entail developing and/or evolving a software system, following a full development cycle from requirements specification through to implementation and testing using up-to-date industrial development tools and processes. At the end of the course they will provide a presentation and demonstration of their project work to the class. There is no formal teaching of a programming language in this unit, although students will be expected to demonstrate through their project work their general software engineering and architectural skills as well as their mastery of model-based methods and technologies.
Students successfully completing this unit will have a strong practical and theoretical understanding of the modern software development cycle as applied in industrial settings. In particular, they will be familiar with the latest model-based software engineering approaches necessary for successfully dealing with today&rsquo;s highly complex and challenging software systems.</p>
<p>The pedagogic grounds for this course and its focus on model-based approaches are to arm new software engineers with skills and perspectives that extend beyond the level of basic programming. Such skills are essential to success in software development nowadays, and are in great demand but very low supply. The dearth of such expertise is one of the key reasons behind the alarmingly high failure rate of industrial software projects (currently estimated at being greater than 40%). Therefore, this unit complements SQE and strengthens a key area in the program.</p>

<p>My intended plan is to take  COMPSYS 302 in Part III Semester 1, and hence it will be a semester with 5 core courses.  And for SOFTENG 325, I decided to swap it with a part IV elective and enroll it in part IV. Thus I am thinking of take 3 courses during exchange - 2 of them are equivalent courses from part III and 1 of them is equivalent course from part IV.</p>
<p>In the Host University Preferences &amp; Proposed Courses Form, it asks to list a minimum of 8 potential courses for each university. I was struggling to find 8 equivalent courses to fill in the list, shall I only list the courses that I have been approved?</p>
